                                    Formed in 2009, The Luke Johnson Band has been illuminating the party principle in every crowd they encounter.  People stop and listen as if they don't believe what is happening, "Is this the same band that was playing that last tune?"  Yes, LJB goes all the way when they perform each song, jumping from supple to intense, from rock to bluegrass and back again.  Be prepared for anything because these guys follow the current of ideas in every moment, resulting in freshly spread jams aside sculpted grooves with clear intent.  To sum it up these guys deliver the goods.

                                    <br>
                                    Born in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, keyboardist and singer/songwriter, Luke Johnson has dreamed of being a musician since he was old enough to reach the piano keys.  Like most musicians, Luke began as a fan, growing up in a house that was always filled with music. 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    His first instrument was his voice and he sang more than he spoke. Then destiny seemed to take a hand providing him with his first guitar and piano. His first guitar was actually salvaged from the trash by his father.  Luke was fortunate enough to apprentice under local bluegrass legend; Murphy Henry at age eleven.  His piano skill evolved through sheer force of will, he discovered an upright piano at a friend's house and spent hours teaching himself to play.  As Luke's musical style developed his main focus shifted to the piano.  While he enjoys recording and composing, his first love is live performances, an opportunity to connect with and impart a message to a room full of both friends and strangers.

                                    <br>
                                    Luke's influences are as widespread as his own compositions, he has been inspired from everyone from Fat's Domino to Bernie Worrell (P-Funk) and Thelonious Monk.  The range of musical acts with whom Luke has played and recorded during the last fifteen years serves as evidence of just how versatile his talent is.  From the funky jams of Earthbound Shakedown to the folksy rock of Freewheelin, and the dance grooves of Bob Jecktive, Luke always adds another unexpected dimension of sound with his soulful keys and unique vocals.  Currently, Luke is booking and touring with his eclectic act, Luke Johnson Band as well as playing Latin-infused rock with After Destiny. (http://www.myspace.com/afterdestiny) Luke also has been known to sit in with various acts and play solo shows from time to time.

                                    <br>
                                    The opportunities to travel and perform have led Luke to many festivals and venues such as 8X10 in Baltimore, MD, Alley Katz in Richmond, VA, CULM in Pittsburg, PA and The Spot in Newark, NJ.  He has had the privilege of opening the stage for acts like Melvin Seals and Jerry Garcia Band, Rusted Root, Parliament/Funkadelic, Toubab Krewe, ekoostik hookah, The Recipe, The Hackensaw Boys, Donna the Buffalo, Project Object, The Bridge, Funk Ark,  Vince Herman, Papa Mali, Vince Welnick, Tom Constanten, and many more.

                                    Luke's latest labor of love is his debut album Light Bringer, it takes an introspective journey through the genres of rock, funk, jazz and bluegrass.  Brimming with diverse original compositions and funky grooves, every cut on Light Bringer is unique.  Tracks from Light Bringer are currently in rotation on radio stations such as 89.9 WNRS Charlottesville, 89.7 WSHC Shepherdstown and 96.5 WCTG Chincoteague.  "Love Like Yours" is also featured in the July 2010 Bonnaroo issue of Relix magazine.  To download Luke's album check out cd baby and itunes.   http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/lukejohnson3

                                    Luke and his wife Kendra live in West Virginia, when he is not writing or playing music, Luke is exploring the great outdoors.  He is serious about having fun while hiking and canoeing in "the wilds" of WV.  Luke continues to perform live at venues (http://www.myspace.com/lukejohnsonband) all over the east coast.

                                    <br>
                                    Steve was born in Annapolis, MD but grew up on the outskirts of Winchester, VA.  As a youngster he sang in the school chorus and played trombone for the band.  With the help of his grandmother, who was an avid pianist, he even managed to earn a few solos at those performances.  This helped him learn music and really start to grasp the concept of musicality.  Steve had his first experience with the trap kit at a very early age.  His uncle would let him hammer out beats on his vintage Ludwig Vistalites.  Eventually his generous uncle gave the drums to him and Steve began to take music and drumming more seriously.  He has studied with various masters including Alfonso Young, Grant Menefee, and Matt Wilson.  Steve enjoys exploring all genres of music and continues to lay down the groove wherever he is needed.  Steve has also played with the following acts:  Stezakma, Too Many Chiefs, Treehouse, Earthbound Shakedown, The Bloody 9's, The Lady Dies, and Free Wheelin'.

                                    <br>
                                    Logan began his serious interest in music when he 
                                    took up the cello at age 10.   He continued to explore new instruments including guitar and saxophone but knew he had found his niche when he picked up the 5- string.  The electric bass has long since been his passion because of its potential power and its diverse abilities.  In recent years, Logan has had success with many different bands such as the Dub Star Divers, Night Lab, and Naked Not Nude.  As well as holding down the groove in The Luke Johnson Band, he is working with Noetic Pull, a dynamic band featuring 2 bass players and 2 percussionists.  Logan is always forging new paths with-in every moment he finds to write, practice, and perform music.   Others take notice, and listen.

                                    <img src="images\bio_erik_hs.jpg" align="right"><h2>Erik Janus - Guitar</h2>Erik began music theory and basic piano at age 7 and has been playing guitar for over 30 years.  Growing up, he was a teenage metal head and jammed in several high school bands where he explored the likes of Black Sabbath, Rush, Led Zeppelin and Van Halen.  In the mid-80s everything changed when he went to go see the Grateful Dead and he has been hooked on meaningful improvisational music ever since.   His influences today span from the Dead Kennedys to Phish to Rahsaan Roland Kirk to Devo and pairs nicely with a band that redefines genres at the drop of a hat.  Quick on his feet, he is always ready to pounce in that knock out moment that uplifts the crowd and brings the funk full circle.  Erik lives just outside Shepherdstown, WV with his wife, young son, and an inspiring pile of musical instruments.
